# The Primes Computation program using Miller's Test

This program is built upon the concept of Miller's test and uses a completely bias-free method to provide accurate probabilistic chances of primes passing the test, an efficient primality test limited by Python's slow interpreter speeds, as well as the lack of multicore processing and multithreading which I may add at one point.

Simply put, this program is a primality test program, it tests whether a number you input is prime or not using one of today's most modern efficient methods of primality testing -- the miller's test.

## Installing / Getting started

Python Interpreter 3+ is required in order to compile the code, you may build this into an executable through other means if you wish. 
Standard compilation is all that is needed.

```shell
python primality_test_main.py
```

Once the code is executed, follow the instructions on the screen.

## Developing

```shell
git clone https://github.com/faycalki/primality_test_using_millers_test.git
```

## Features

* Efficiently checks for primality with customizeable amount of integers to check against for the sake of speed.
* Bias free probabilistic chance for primality passing the test, also computes the chance of it passing the test.
* Minimal dependencies.
* Can be implemented as a fully modular program with minimal editing, built as a function.
