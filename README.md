# The Primes Computation program using Miller's Test

This program is built upon the concept of Miller's test and uses a completely bias-free method to provide accurate probabilistic chances of primes passing the test.

## Installing / Getting started

Python Interpreter 3+ is required in order to compile the code, you may build this into an executable through other means if you wish. 
Standard compilation is all that is needed.

```shell
python primes_computation.py
```

Once the code is executed, follow the instructions on the screen.

## Developing

```shell
git clone https://github.com/faycalki/primes_computation_with_millers_test.git
```

## Features

* Efficiently checks for primality with customizeable amount of integers to check against for the sake of speed.
* Bias free probabilistic chance for primality passing the test, also computes the chance of it passing the test.
* Minimal dependencies.
* Can be implemented as a fully modular program with minimal editing, built as a function.
